# GLUCO_WATCH_NIR
This technology enables the non-invasive measurement of blood glucose levels in humans without causing any harm to human tissue. It utilizes a NIR sensor to capture
voltage output, which is then analyzed using a specific equation derived from real data correlating the NIR signal to
the corresponding body glucose level in mg/dl.
